        <p>You should reload or 'Ctrl-F5' to reload page forcefully. <br>
            Otherwise smart browsers will just use cache with old<br>
            webpage/code to render the "current webpage". Also clearing
            cache can help. Sometimes writing couple console.log() statements
            help to know you are running the latest version of your code.
        </p>
            
        <p>Try to use relative styling versus absolute styling for more
        webpage flexibility.</p>
    
        <p>Make Sure to Include Javascript Links at end to ensure
        page elements are loaded first.</p>
        
    </div>
    <div id="documentation">
        <h3 align="center">Documentation for tma1.htm</h3>
        <p>To create tma1.htm, a top navbar was used as shown above.
        This navbar is used to allow the user to navigate any part of the assignment.
        As requested for tma1.htm, a cover page which contains all the details is presented.
        <br/><br/>
        An accordion/collapsible menu is also created with some Javascript logic to allow
        user to find out more details about each link found in the navbar. All the opened
        panels can be closed by click "Close All Tabs".
        <br/><br/>
        Also a section for "Tips and Tricks Learned in Assignment#1" is added to take up
        extra blank space in the web page and to add some insightful tricks that may prove useful
        later in the course.
        <br/><br/>
        To allow a consistent feel of the web application/site, the top nav bar and the footer
        is used to give the feeling of being in the same web site.
