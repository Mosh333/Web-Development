on 

editButton2 & editButton3

store or remove the quizButton from:
quizMenuContainer

---------------------------------------
editButton1, when Submit or OK is pressed (after changes),
make sure to add dynamically (using closures),
the quiz Events similar to what is done for Unit Quizzes 1 2 & 3

---------------------------------------
After test that everything works.
If it works congrats :)
Move on to the next part!!!!






******************************************************
To-do
-Done



Done
-addEventListener for when grading the newly made quizzes
    a)When we delete, the newer/newly added elements not deleted from question array hence questionArray increasing in size
        fix: for loop i from 0 to max was bad
             for loop i from max to 0 was good
    b)To overcome issue of duplication of a certain quiz question sets of 7,
      used DOM to manage and hide all inactive quizzes &/or use flags to prevent
      multiple "identical" quizzes being produced
-find an easy fix to the switching intermediate editing stage (when editing and looking to switch force them to save) (flags used)
-Main issue maybe the change button event listener is not doing the correct bookkeeping
    a)add functionality for "Add Question"; that is using DOM to add another form which includes the necessary bookkeeping
    b)test, verify, and correct remove functionality (fails if 12 questions, but remove question 11)
-GET DEFAULT SELECT VALUES INITIALIZED AFTER A NEW QUIZ HAS BEEN SUBMITTED (Done)
-think of how to deal with placeholder management/saving of forms where a version has been saved
-revisit the remove functionality especially after a new quiz has been made
-deal with issue when switching between editing quizzes while not done editing -->doesn't work ALWAYS but good enough

main.js:1791 Uncaught TypeError: Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node': parameter 1 is not of type 'Node'.
    at HTMLParagraphElement.<anonymous> (main.js:1791) ---> forgot index, and the clicking technique is not reliable esp. with timing issues
    
    removeChild() is almost guranteed to never miss timing
