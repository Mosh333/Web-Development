        <p class="doNotCenter">
            &emsp; Part 1 asks for an implementation of a basic hit-counter service
            for the webpage. The application must also display the client accessing the webpage their
            time zone where they are located and their IP address.

        <img id="slideshowHome" src="shared/images/slideshow.png" style="width: 50px; height: 50px"></img>
        <p class="doNotCenter">
            &emsp; Part 2 asks for an implementation of a slideshow in ASP.net using C# as the
            server side programming language to drive the slideshow logic. This app was implemented 
            using a JSON file which stored the exact same JSON data arracy which stored the
            slideshow data from Assignment #1 part 3. Newtonsoft.JSON.net framework was used to read the JSON
            data, which parses the JSON data into a usable C# array or list format. I used the framework
            because otherwise the parsing would have been difficult. I am sorry about this Dr. Wang.

        <p class="doNotCenter">
            &emsp; Part 3 asks for an implementation of an ecommerce website for selling
            computers and related parts. Designs from websites such as BestBuy and Amazon
            was studied to implement the store. Main task of this store was to have a
            product tracker implemented within the store to allow the customers to select
            and store their products choices in the cart. The product tracker was made to
            be as dynamic and interactive as possible. The tracking was implemented using
            Cookies, and a C# clientCart class was designed to facilitate this tracking
            of the user.

            &emsp; <bold>Please note, I only completed Task#1 of this assignment.</bold>
            Tasks #2 and #3 were not attempted due to time constraints.<br />
            For this part it was asked to take the design from part 3 of this assignment and
            support as much of the web application with database. This included the
            customer management module (part 1, implemented in login.aspx), order management module
            (which essentially completes the product tracker from part 3 to dump all the customer
            product information into the database), and finally replace any hardcoded data from
            part 3 to be stored in the database.

            Technologies used are HTML, CSS, Javascript, ASP.net in C#, Azure, and SendGrid
            framework for sending emails (the standard way of sending emails in ASP.net now).
